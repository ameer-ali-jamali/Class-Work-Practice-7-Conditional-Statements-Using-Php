 # PHP Conditional Statements
Conditional Statements are used to perform actions based on different conditions. Sometimes when we write a program, we want to perform some different actions for different actions. We can solve this by using conditional statements. 

In PHP we have these conditional statements:
if Statement ,
if-else Statement ,
If-elseif-else Statement ,
Switch statement
